**An engineer.** <br />
Loves to be called as an engineer.

For me, **an engineer is a person who solves difficult problems by using appropriate technologies.**

<br />
Worked before as an front-end developer, using React and TypeScript. <br />
Experienced with Node.js and Nest.js.<br /><br />

Nowadays, mainly uses Go for most back-end projects.

## 🎈 Motto
> Festina lente.

I was always in a haste. 🏃‍♀️ Haste didn't help me to get things done. <br />
Patience did. I always try to be calm and patient. 🧘
