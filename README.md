**An engineer.** <br />
Loves to be called as an engineer, because I always believed, and still believe now that engineer is the most coolest job in the world.

For me, **an engineer is a person who solves difficult problems by using appropriate technologies.**

<br />
Worked before as an front-end developer, using React and TypeScript. <br />
Experienced with Node.js and Nest.js.<br /><br />

Nowadays mainly uses **Go**, and **Python** for living. <br />
Those languages makes me to earn money 💸, and the money makes me to buy cups of coffee ☕️, and the coffee makes me to code. ⌨️ <br />

Interested in **Rust**, and **building a browser from scratch**, because it's cool. ❄️

## 🎈 Motto
> Festina lente.

I was always in a haste. 🏃‍♀️ Haste didn't help me to get things done. <br />
Patience did. I always try to be calm and patient. 🧘
